	  <h2 class="style1">Recommendations</h2>
		<p class="para1">After the location map analysis, high risk intersection analysis, condition analysis, collision factor analysis, injury analysis and pedestrian &amp; bike analysis, there is a series of recommendations below:</p>
        <h3 class="style1"><br>Public Transportation Encourage</h3>
        <p class="para1">Improve the Safety Environment of Public Transportation<br>One of the key issues that people in City of Los Angeles don’t choose public transportation is due to the safety issue. People complain about meeting crazy people in the public transportation and worry about their safety. Bus drivers should be trained to deal with such emergency issue. In the meanwhile, building the good image of LA public transportation by social media such as twitter and Facebook is also of great importance and will have impact on young people living in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p class="para1">Set up Public Transportation Promotion System<br>It’s also necessary to create the atmosphere and culture that people regard taking public
transportation as a natural part of life. Although the City of Los Angeles have several types of public transportation such as Dash and Metro, the connection and transfer convenience between these public transportation systems is not good enough. Therefore, combination of these public transportation systems should be concerned.</p>
        <h3 class="style1"><br>New Infrastructure</h3>
        <p class="para1">Bicycle Lanes Construction<br>In comparison with other big cities such as NYC, City of Los Angeles still lacks a lot of bike lanes. For those streets with greatest number of bicycle-involved collisions, such as Sunset Blvd, Western Avenue and Vermont Blvd, there’s nearly no bicycle-friendly lanes at all. City of Los Angeles should complement more bicycle lane construction projects according to the degree of urgency and necessity based on collision frequency.</p>
        <p class="para1">Traffic Signals and Signs<br>Based on general analysis, Koreatown and Downtown LA have greatest numbers of traffic collisions related to traffic signals and signs issue. For traffic signals issue, cameras can be installed on necessary intersections to capture auto violation and also be utilized to warn
potential violation behaviors.</p>
        <h3 class="style1"><br>Data Collection Improvement</h3>
        <p class="para1">Provide Zip Code or Official Region Names along with GPS Data<br>Zip code and Official region names can help the collision visualization process. Patterns and Clusters in terms of specific administrative districts are more likely to be detected.</p>
        <p class="para1">Avoid Ambiguous Names of Roads<br>For example, 101ST STREET, 101ST STREET(W), and 101ST STREET(N) should be recategorized into only two classes for the accuracy of future data analysis.</p>
        <p class="para1">Keep the consistency of Records<br>For example, in injury table, “number killed” are not all records of consecutive years. This
lack of records may impede timeline related analysis of injury data.</p>
        <h3 class="style1"><br>Rush Hour Policies</h3>
        <p class="para1">Temporary limit based on odd-and-even license plate can be implement to improve traffic congestion during rush hours. From another perspective, public transportation should have discount to commuters during rush hours to encourage them choosing public transportation instead of private cars.</p>
        <h3 class="style1"><br>Patrol/Police Distribution</h3>
        <p class="para1">Based on high risk timeline and location analysis reports, Patrol/Police should be distributed accordingly to avoid certain violations and deal with traffic collisions in time.</p>
